# Experiment 7 — Measurement and Analysis of a Magic Tee
---

## Aim

To measure the isolation between the E and H arms of a magic tee and study the characteristics of the magic tee.

## Apparatus Used

Klystron power supply, klystron mount, isolator, attenuator, frequency meter, VSWR meter, magic tee and matched terminations.

## Theory

A four-port junction combining an E-plane and an H-plane tee is called a **hybrid tee**. When matching elements are introduced to reduce reflections it becomes a **magic tee**.

The arm forming an H-plane tee with the collinear arms is the **H-arm** (shunt arm); the arm forming an E-plane tee with them is the **E-arm** (series arm). The shunt and series arms are polarised — the voltage vectors in the two arms are perpendicular — so as long as nothing in the junction rotates the polarisation there can be no coupling between them. Posts and irises match the E and H arms to minimise reflections from these two ports.

The "magic" lies in how power divides among the arms:

* A signal fed into the shunt (H) arm divides equally and **in phase** into the two side arms, with no coupling to the E-arm.
* A signal fed into the series (E) arm also divides equally into the two side arms, but the halves are **180° out of phase**, with no coupling to the H-arm.
* Power fed into one side arm divides equally into the shunt and series arms with no coupling to the other side arm.

That is, **opposite arms of a magic tee are isolated**. The magic tee can also be used as a signal combiner: signals fed into both side arms combine in phase at the H-arm and 180° out of phase at the E-arm.

A magic tee is normally characterised by two quantities:

1. **Isolation between E and H arms** — with power P_E flowing into the E-arm and P_H flowing out of the H-arm (both collinear arms match-terminated):

   ```
   Isolation (dB) = −10 log₁₀ (P_H / P_E)
   ```

2. **Power division in the collinear arms** — the power fed into either the E or H arm should divide equally between the side arms when the opposite port is match-terminated. With P_C1 and P_C2 the side-arm powers:

   ```
   Coupling (dB) = −10 log₁₀ (P_C1 / P_H) = −10 log₁₀ (P_C2 / P_H)
   ```

## Procedure


1. Set up the equipment as shown in Figure.
2. Keep the control knobs of the klystron power supply as follows:

   | Control | Setting |
   |---|---|
   | Mode switch | AM |
   | Beam voltage knob | Fully anti-clockwise |
   | Repeller voltage knob | Fully clockwise |
   | Meter switch | Cathode voltage position |
3. Measure the values from the VSWR meter for E-Arm and H-Arm as input port.

## Observation (Measurement of isolation between E and H arms)

| S.No | Input Arm | Output Arm | VSWR Meter Reading / Power (dB) | Isolation (dB) |
| ---: | --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------: | -------------: |
|    1 | E-arm     | H-arm      |                            1 dB |           1 dB |
|    2 | H-arm     | E-arm      |                            1 dB |           1 dB |

Isolation (dB)=−10log10​(PE​PH​​)


PE=20dB

PH=1dB

Isolation=PE−PH=20-1 

=Isolation=19dB
	​

## Precautions

* Check the connections before switching on the kit.
* Make all connections properly.
* Take the observations carefully.

## Conclusion

Thus, the characteristics of the magic tee were studied and the isolation between the E-arm and H-arm was measured. The E-arm and H-arm are isolated from each other, and the power is equally divided between the two collinear arms.

Isolation=19dB
